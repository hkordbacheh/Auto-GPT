One type of funding, which is sometimes overlooked and which can be quite powerful, is corporate venture funds.Corporate venture funds come in different shapes and sizes, but typically, they are funds affiliated with large companies that are interested in tapping into innovation taking place within particular industries. Loosely referred to as \"strategic\" investors, they represent a fast-growing segment of the funding market. According to CB Insights, there are nearly 200 active corporate VC funds. In 2015, they invested about $18 billion across 850 companies in the United States alone. Notable funders include Google/GV, Comcast Ventures, Bloomberg, Intel Capital and Salesforce Ventures.\nGiven the size and scope of these funds (and despite some industry misconceptions), corporate VCs present a strong option for entrepreneurs looking to get the most value from their investors.So, what are several of the unique advantages that they offer? Related: How to Start a Business With (Almost) No Money\n1. Market validationCorporate VC funds can provide access to established customers and accelerate a startup's ability to find its product/market fit. Most companies creating these funds tend to have large installed customer bases and can identify early adopters for new technology. Gaining this type of entry can be difficult for an unknown startup still trying to build its credibility. The value of nailing down product/market fit cannot be understated as it sets the stage for acquiring a company's first set of paying customers. 2. Revenue growthOnce market validation is achieved, developing a commercial agreement can generate much-needed revenue in the early days of a startup. This should be set up as a stand-alone agreement -- not tied to the investment agreement -- that provides market value to both sides. By securing paying customers, you can lessen the requirements for outside capital and, at the same time, demonstrate a sustainable business model. Related: 22 Qualities That Make a Great Leader3. Domain expertiseSince large companies have a history of being in business, they possess institutional knowledge that can help startups think about issues related to their target market. Daily interactions with customers produce insights that may have implications to a startup's product or marketing strategy. Furthermore, a startup can improve its visibility in a competitive landscape.\n4. Access to capitalSecuring an investment from one strategic investor can encourage others to do the same, because if a strategic partner understands the market and the problem and it's willing to put money into a company, then there must be value there. Plus, many corporate investors, whether they are investing from the parent company's balance sheet or a dedicated fund, will invest in multiple rounds. This renewed commitment is a positive market signal and can ease the burden of additional fundraising. Related: Habits of the World's Wealthiest People (Infographic)5. Inherent exit optionUnsurprisingly, investors often choose to liquidate their positions in a business, particularly if they acquire new companies with pre-existing commercial relationships. Over time, as a relationship develops, dependencies can occur that spur an acquirer to want to own the assets, for offensive or defensive reasons. Diligence for these types of deals is a bit easier as the acquirer is already familiar with the company's business and executive team, which makes things move along more quickly. While corporate venture funds are not silver bullets for getting customers or formulating an exit from day one, they can provide a lot of shareholder value if leveraged properly.\nArie Abecassis\nTech Entrepreneur and Investor\nArie Abecassis is a startup entrepreneur and investor based in New York City.

You may notice that many of the ideas on this list have been growing in popularity recently. Others have been popular for a long time, making them more competitive but less risky. However, all the small business ideas below will help make you money.\nStart selling online now with Shopify\nStart your free trial\n30 best business ideas of 2023\nIf you have been asking yourself what business to start, then this list is for you. According to small business statistics, one of the biggest motivations for opening your own business is being your own boss. Owning a business gives you the freedom to work when, where, or how you want.\nWant to work at a beach or your grandma’s house? Go ahead, no one is going to stop or question you. This is the dream life many people hope to live one day, and thanks to some great business ideas, achieving that lifestyle is well within your reach.\nLet’s take a look at the list of business ideas that’ll make you money in 2023:\n1. Dropshipping\nAre you looking to sell products online but don’t have the money to buy and store inventory? Consider dropshipping! Dropshipping is an ecommerce business model in which you don’t have to manage any physical products.\nAll you have to do is set up an online store and partner with suppliers who are ready to store, package, and ship orders to your customers. There’s no need to spend hours on product research, because you can use dropshipping apps like Automizely to find awesome products to sell.\nCheck out this dropshipping course from Shopify to learn more about selling online without inventory. If you’re searching for easy online business ideas to pursue, it would be hard to find something that tops dropshipping. It’s one of the simplest businesses to start if you have access to the right tools and resources.\nThe biggest reason people are often drawn to dropshipping is that you don’t have to hold inventory. However, if holding inventory isn’t an issue (maybe there’s enough room in that spare closet), you can consider sourcing products wholesale.\nOnline marketplaces like Handshake enable small business owners to find unique, high-quality products and build long-lasting relationships with suppliers. It’s worth checking out as a supplement to dropshipping if you already know what you want to sell.\n2. Print on Demand\nIf you’re looking for proven business ideas to execute, try print on demand.\nPrint on demand (POD) is when you sell your own custom designs on items like phone cases, mugs, and t-shirts, but you don’t actually print the artwork. Instead, you collaborate with suppliers who print your design on the product—they even package and ship the item to your customer, so you don’t have to worry about logistics. Also, you only pay once you have sold the products. No sales equals no costs.\nOne of the quickest ways to get started is to create a Shopify store and install a POD app like Printify. In terms of marketing, partnering with Instagram influencers to promote your POD items is an effective way to reach audiences. To evaluate whether print on demand is the right option for you, watch our video where we get into a healthy debate with Wholesale Ted (a print-on-demand company).\n3. Translation\nMultilingual people are always in demand, so if you can speak two or more languages, consider starting a small business where you can monetize those skills.\nYou can look for clients on Upwork and Flexjobs and slowly build your portfolio. As you work successfully with more and more companies, you can hire more translators who specialize in other languages to take things off your plate. It’s also a good idea to market your business on social media websites, as it can help you reach a wider audience.\nGot only a few hours to spare each day? Translation is one of the best side business ideas to pursue, as it lets you schedule your clients based on when you are available to work.\n4. Website Flipping\nWebsite flipping is among the new business ideas that have gotten everyone from work-at-home parents to recent graduates excited. It involves buying an already running website, improving its design and content, and then selling it for a profit.\nThere are quite a few places where you can buy and sell websites to earn a profit. Shopify’s marketplace, Exchange, for example, allows you to buy ecommerce websites that you can further improve via content marketing, SEO, and other tactics. Once your site begins to generate more revenue than when you acquired it, you can list it for sale on the marketplace.\n5. Home-based Catering\nIf you have a knack for cooking and see it as a creative outlet, you can make a decent income by opening a home-based catering business.\nThe initial investment depends on how big you want the setup to be. For example, if you start with smaller events that you can manage on your own, you should be able to start your business for less.\nMost home-based caterers start by creating a website, experimenting with local food markets, or joining platforms that allow cooking experts to squeeze some profits from their culinary skills.\n6. Dog walking\nIt can be difficult to keep up with a furry friend, particularly high-energy breeds with limited outdoor access. As a professional dog walker, you’ll be helping pet owners in the community keep their dogs happy, healthy, and well exercised.\nDog walking requires no initial investments other than marketing and business liability insurance. This will protect you in case of accidents, bites, or unexpected lawsuits. It’s a good idea to charge prices that reflect your insurance costs, with the average range between $30 to $60 an hour.\nYou can establish a presence for your dog walking business on a number of platforms, including Wag!, Rover, and Care.com. Offer promotions for new clients and build a positive reputation by requesting reviews from those you’ve worked with in the past.\n7. Virtual assistance\nOne of the most successful business ideas is to offer virtual assistant services. Everyone from large enterprises to solopreneurs requires help with the day-to-day management of their business. You can use your excellent organizational skills to take some weight off their shoulders.\nOf course, you’ll get paid for the time and effort you put into answering emails, scheduling meetings, and performing other administrative duties.\nYou can land your first few clients by responding to listings on platforms like FreeUp, PeoplePerHour, or Virtual Assistant Jobs. This is a proven business model, as people are always looking for efficient virtual assistants.\n8. Personal shopping","Source: https://www.oberlo.com/blog/business-ideas-that-make-money\nContent summary part#1: The article provides a list of 30 small business ideas for 2023, including dropshipping, print on demand, translation, website flipping, home-based catering, dog walking, virtual assistance, personal shopping, and more. The article emphasizes the benefits of owning a business, such as being your own boss and having the freedom to work when, where, or how you want. The article also suggests using platforms like Shopify and social media to market and promote your business.","Source: https://www.oberlo.com/blog/business-ideas-that-make-money\nRaw content part#2: Do you often get praised for your eye for fashion trends? Are you someone who friends and family come to for clothing advice? Personal shopping can be a business that builds on those skills.\nPersonal shoppers find clothing items for clients who don’t have time to shop for themselves. Duties involve evaluating your client’s wardrobe, visiting websites, and picking items that will suit them. There are all kinds of products on different online clothing boutiques, so you don’t necessarily have to shop offline to get this business started.\nPlus, you don’t need to hold any special certification or degree to become a personal shopper. If your interests lie in business ideas with low investment, personal shopping might be the ideal route to consider.\n9. Car detailing\nContrary to popular belief, it's entirely possible to make car detailing a full-time business. The average profit of car detailing is anywhere from $50 to $400 per vehicle, meaning you could make a healthy profit if you find consistent clients.\nThe key to success in the car detailing business is marketing. You’ll need to spread the word about your services through a website or social media platform, and encourage regular reviews as well. Try to offer discounts for new clients or package deals for those who commit to multiple sessions.\nAll you need to get started are cleaning supplies and a driveway. You may consider getting certified through the IDA or taking a craftsmanship seminar to enhance your skills.\n10. Online tutoring\nIf you’re an expert in art, math, or another subject, you can start the business of online tutoring. An essential prerequisite is having a bachelor’s degree in the subject you intend to teach.\nYou can find online tutoring clients on sites like Skooli and Tutor.com. For the best results, always teach subjects that relate to your area of expertise, because you’ll be able to share your skills and constructive knowledge to enhance your students’ own knowledge. You can deliver lectures and interact with your students over Zoom, making online tutoring one of the easiest online businesses you can start.\n11. Greeting cards\nGreeting cards are always in style, so if you have a good eye for design or just love showcasing your artwork on physical items, this is one of the best creative business ideas for you.\nBefore you can start looking for clients, you’ll need to have a handful of designs ready to go. Tools like Photoshop and Canva make it easy to create custom card designs. Additionally, you’ll need to stock up on supplies required to create greeting cards (ink, paper, etc.).\nPro tip: If you want to keep costs low, consider buying your supplies wholesale. Once you have the inventory, you can start generating revenue by marketing your business on Facebook, Etsy, and other similar platforms.\n12. Content writing\nAlmost every company with a web presence needs help creating content for product pages, blogs, etc.\nAs such, starting a content writing or copywriting company could be one of the most profitable business ideas for you. Popular websites for finding those first few customers include Remote.co, Problogger, and BloggingPro.\nYou can also join content writing groups on Facebook to get more exposure for your business. To make a good impression on clients, consider offering keyword optimization or custom graphics as part of your services.\n13. Homemade products\nIf you have a knack for molding soap bars, brewing drinks, or baking specialty products, a homemade crafts business may be a great fit for you. Not only does it serve as a wonderful creative outlet, but it can easily scale up as word of your business gets out.\nSome of the most profitable homemade products include agricultural products, beauty solutions like cosmetics and soaps, and accessories such as jewelry. Ingredients and raw materials coupled with your labor should provide a sustainable return on investment.\nYou can start selling homemade products at your local farmers market, on a platform like Etsy, or with a storefront on iCraft. Try adding a unique twist to your products, such as dessert-themed bath bombs or pop-culture clothing items.\n14. WordPress support\nA lot of websites out there are hosted on WordPress, and almost every WordPress website owner requires support in some form. So, if you’re familiar with the ins and outs of this platform, you’ll have several opportunities to make money.\nClients may contact you to fix their CSS, find and address security holes, and more. While you can use platforms like PeoplePerHour and Upwork to get your first clients, we recommend creating a custom website and listing your services there. That way, you’ll be able to avoid high commissions and build high-quality relationships with your clients.\nHands down, offering WordPress support is one of the best business ideas to try in 2023.\n15. Career coaching\nWith rising unemployment and a saturated job market, there’s no shortage of people needing help finding jobs. If you have a talent for helping your friends and family find suitable employment, you can probably help others too.\nConsider starting a career coaching business where you help others figure out what the best career for them is, how to nail an interview, what traits define a good candidate, and more. You can look for clients in Facebook groups or on platforms like Coach.me.\nThe best thing about this business is that you can make money by conducting four to five hourly sessions a month. Plus, you can coach multiple clients in a single session. If you’re looking for good business ideas that won’t occupy too much of your time, career coaching may be the right option for you.\n16. Email marketing\nAre you good at writing emails? Have you cracked the code for crafting subject lines that people can’t help but click? If so, you can step into entrepreneurship and make money by launching an email marketing business.\nYou can find companies that need help with their email strategy on platforms like PeoplePerHour and Upwork, as well as via cold outreach. Once you demonstrate that skill of enticing recipients, clients will rush to get your services and even agree to the price you quote them (major brownie points if you can help grow their email list).\nStartup costs include investing in email marketing tools, which will automate many of your tasks.\n17. Contract cleaning\nNot everyone has the time or skills to clean on a regular basis. Becoming a professional cleaner allows you to assist home and business owners with scrubbing, dusting, vacuuming, and more.\nStartup costs for household cleaning businesses are extremely low. Cleaning supplies and materials cost less than $100, although you could also purchase specialty equipment like steam vacuums or carpet cleaners. It’s a good idea to set up a website or social media page to get the word out for cheap.\nThe fees you charge will depend on the needs of your clients. Most cleaners charge by the hour, although some have additional expenses associated with certain tasks (organization, deep cleaning, etc.). Use tools like Angi Leads to display your business and discover what other people are charging. Be sure to register as an LLC and complete all necessary paperwork.\n18. Meals to go\nThere’s no end to the line of people who struggle to find time to cook nutritious and healthy meals. This has led to a rise in meals-to-go businesses, offering all kinds of cuisine options. You can capitalize on this trend by starting your own meals-to-go business in your city, state, or neighborhood.\nContrary to popular belief, you don’t need to invest in designing a large commercial kitchen. A shared rental kitchen is good enough to run a meals-go-to business. These places are usually equipped with essential supplies and can be rented by month, day, or hour. You can find shared-use, licensed commissary kitchens through websites like The Kitchen Door.\n19.

Starting a landscaping business may be the perfect way to turn your hobby into a profitable endeavor. Landscaping services include anything from mowing lawns to planting flowers and shrubs and may or may not be seasonable, depending on your climate.\nDetermine what you can do best in a yard and market your business to a specific audience. Keep a curated portfolio of your best work, including colorful photographs with detailed outcomes for customers. If you offer unique services (fertilizing, pest control, etc.), be sure to highlight that across your social media platforms.\nYou can find your first landscaping clients by going door-to-door in the neighborhood or hopping on platforms like TaskEasy. Websites like HomeAdvisor connect your landscape business with paying clients in your area. You can also get certified with the National Association of Landscape Professionals to boost your credibility.\n20. Website testing\nDid you know that brands with a digital footprint hire real people to give feedback on their websites? These opinions allow them to address issues that their developers may have failed to identify. You can hire a bunch of people on a freelance basis and create your own website testing company.\nAs you take on projects, your employees will receive a set of questions that they need to answer as they navigate a company’s website. Through video, they’ll communicate their initial thoughts on the current user experience and how the site could be improved.\nYou can find work through websites like UserTesting, Ferpection, and TryMyUI.\n21. SEO\nDo you have experience in generating backlinks and improving the search engine visibility of a website? If yes, then there’s an opportunity for you to cash in on your skill set.\nSite owners worldwide require the services of SEO experts, so opening a business in this field could turn out to be one of your best decisions. When looking for clients, focus on a niche audience, learn from the experiences, and build your portfolio—showcase your success stories and you are bound to see an influx of clients if your SEO techniques are on point.\nYou can choose to target all sorts of companies or appeal to businesses in a particular niche, such as in the legal, health, or financial sector. With monthly retainers of $501 to $1,000, selling SEO services is one of the best business ideas to make money in 2023.\n22. App development\nApp development is one of the best profitable small business ideas, since so many companies require an app. Not to mention, the cost of starting this venture has drastically gone down due to the growth of tools and affordable developers.\nToday, you can use software like OmniGraffle or Sketch to create the wireframes and mockups before you decide to publish the app. Alternatively, you can hire a freelance app developer via AngelList and Upwork.\nThere’s also the opportunity to earn passive income by creating apps for the general audience. Of course, that requires you to develop a monetization strategy that generates recurring revenue. Profitable strategies include offering in-app purchases and charging for a premium version of your app.\n23. Stock photography\nIf you have the ability to capture great candid moments or recently did a portrait shoot of a relative, you can become a stock photographer by registering a sole proprietorship under your name.\nCompanies like Shutterstock, Adobe Stock, and the like are always open for image submissions. You can start by listing a few of your existing photos on these platforms. Once you’ve submitted your photographs, wait for people to download them.\nMost stock photography websites pay you a royalty for every download on their platform. Another option is to launch your own photography website and sell images directly to people, which is only viable if you have the resources to invest in marketing.\n24. Virtual dance studio\nThe upsides to a virtual dance studio are pretty obvious: you don’t need to rent a big space, and it’s convenient to record, publish, and share the choreography at your own discretion. It’s even possible to give dance classes from home, making it one of the best home-based business ideas. Plus, there’s no limit to the number of students you can enroll in your class.\nTo start a virtual dance studio, you’ll need to invest in video conferencing software, such as Zoom. You’ll also need high-speed internet to ensure there are no lags or buffering during the livestream. Make sure to arrange enough classes per month so that your students learn their routines fast.\nIf you have a passion for creating your own unique choreography, you may also find opportunities to partner with dance schools to give their students access to your content on a membership basis.\n25. Instagram consulting\nIf you know the secrets to Instagram engagement, consider becoming an Instagram consultant. Clients will pay you for creating engaging captions, responding to comments, creating attractive bios, and more.\nYou can monetize these services by charging a specific rate per hour or by project. This is the perfect business idea for digital nomads, as everything can be managed from a laptop or smartphone.\nTo become a sought-after Instagram consultant, master the skill of creating killer Instagram ads that get people to engage and buy from businesses. You can get your first clients by marketing your business on Upwork and other social media platforms.\n26. Video production\nAccording to video marketing statistics, 85% of internet users in the US watched an online video on their devices. With more and more videos being watched than ever before, there’s certainly a need for people who can record, edit, cut, and publish videos. Therefore, starting a video production company might turn out to be a lucrative business idea for you.\nThe initial investment in this business is a basic lighting set, wireless microphones, one to two cameras (and lenses), and editing software like Adobe Premiere or Final Cut Pro. See if you can find second-hand varieties for some of this equipment in order to reduce startup costs.\nYou can offer to produce video content for companies’ YouTube channels, manage graduation and wedding videography, and more. While there’s no restriction to the types of projects you can do, specializing in a niche makes it easy to stand out in a busy marketplace.\n27. Software education\nDo you have acquaintances who lack proficiency in computer software? If so, you can set up your own software education business and enroll students on a monthly basis.\nPupils might include entrepreneurs looking to build on their IT skills, or other small business owners looking to master software like Excel and PowerPoint. If you have the expertise, you can lead from the front by teaching most classes.\nAs your business grows and more people sign up for your programs, you can hire freelance software experts to teach students based on their area of expertise. Although you can rent out space for classroom lectures, consider hosting virtual classes to keep costs low and expand your business to international markets.\n28. College preparation\nHelping high schoolers get accepted into college is a booming business. According to IBISWorld, the market size of the testing and educational support industry was $17.9 billion last year, so there’s a lot of money to be made if you can gain a foothold in the market.\nTo start, pick a certain area of college prep you’d like to run your business around. For instance, you can offer ACT tutoring, help students brush up on practice admission essays, etc. Once you’ve narrowed your focus, it’s time to register and introduce the business to students.\n29. Niche staffing agency\nNearly every industry has open jobs, and employers are keen to hire the best people for their companies. Your task as a niche staffing agency is to match employees to employers in your sector of choice.\nFigure out what type of roles you’ll be staffing (Junior? Mid-level? C-level?) so that you can identify the right candidates for the position. Additionally, consider the employment terms that your agency will share with potential candidates.","Source: https://www.oberlo.com/blog/business-ideas-that-make-money\nContent summary part#3: The text provides 29 new business ideas, including landscaping, website testing, SEO, app development, stock photography, virtual dance studio, Instagram consulting, video production, software education, college preparation, and niche staffing agency.

When your website is optimized for search, you improve the likelihood that your site will rank higher on search engine results pages (SERPs) and thus be more visible to those searching for your services or products.\nWhy Is SEO Important?\nEffective SEO is crucial for driving quality traffic to your website. The goal of SEO is to help those interested in your business offerings find you online. Optimizing your site for search improves the odds that those performing related online searches will find your company and click through to your website.\nHigh click-through rates (CTRs) increase the opportunities you have to engage with your website visitors, make a connection and either make a sale or establish a relationship that sets the stage for closing a sale down the line.\nSEO vs. SEM\nThere are two ways to drive traffic to your website: organically or via paid methods. SEO is an organic search strategy that optimizes your site with the best content that satisfies searcher intentions. Search engine marketing (SEM) involves all digital marketing strategies—both paid and organic—used to drive traffic to your website via search engines. SEM often involves SEO and paid search strategies, such as pay-per-click advertisements.\nHow To Choose the Best SEO Service","Source: https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/software/best-seo-services/\nContent summary part#4: The article discusses the top SEO services available for businesses looking to improve their website's visibility on search engines. These services offer various strategies for optimizing a website, including analyzing competitive data, identifying keyword strengths and weaknesses, addressing site coding issues, and developing content marketing and link acquisition strategies. The article also highlights the importance of SEO for driving quality traffic to a website and improving click-through rates. Additionally, the article distinguishes between SEO and SEM, which involves both paid and organic digital marketing strategies. Pricing for these SEO services is customized to each business's specific needs and budget.","Source: https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/software/best-seo-services/\nRaw content part#5: When selecting an SEO service, you should first consider your SEO goals. Then, spend time with a few SEO service providers to discuss those needs in light of what each agency delivers. It’s also helpful to speak with current or past clients.\nSEO service providers help you increase your visibility in search engines and thereby assist you in generating more traffic for your website. An SEO service provider may conduct a variety of tasks, including auditing your existing website for SEO effectiveness, conducting keyword searches, developing an SEO plan to outrank your competition and writing SEO copy for your site.\nTypes of SEO Services\nBefore purchasing SEO services, it’s wise to get a handle on the different types of SEO available. Understanding the basics will give you a considerable advantage when evaluating SEO agencies.\nOn-Page SEO: On-page SEO involves optimizing on-page content elements such as headlines, page content, image alt-tags, page titles and the page URL. Including appropriate internal and external links within your content also boosts on-page SEO.\nOff-Page SEO: Off-page SEO involves tactics that improve your overall search rankings but are irrelevant to individual page content. Building high-authority backlinks to your site is a critical off-page SEO service that a top-notch SEO service group should provide.\nTechnical SEO: Search engines need to understand your site content and structure, so an up-to-date XML sitemap is crucial for effective technical SEO. Other technical SEO musts include eliminating site problems, such as slow page load times, mobile responsiveness issues, duplicate content and HTTP error codes, for example, 404, which indicates content is not found.\nLocal SEO: Some service providers specialize in helping your site rank higher than competitors in your local market. Optimizing your Google Business Profile listing is key to local SEO success; a reputable local SEO service provider can handle this for you.\nE-Commerce SEO: Websites built for e-commerce need to be optimized somewhat differently than non-e-commerce sites. Some SEO agencies specialize in helping websites with online stores increase site traffic and improve sales conversion metrics.\nVoice SEO: Voice search users typically ask conversational questions that contain more words in their search string than used in a text search. Voice SEO is particularly important for local service or hospitality businesses likely to benefit immediately from people looking for options for urgent needs, such as the nearest service station, bakery or dog groomer.\nPortfolios and Results\nWhen evaluating SEO service providers, be sure to look at their client portfolio and case studies that detail what they’ve accomplished for others. Pay attention to whether the SEO service specializes in specific industries or audiences and their typical client size.\nGet a clear idea of what results might be possible—based on what the provider has done for others—as well as how long it will take for the new SEO efforts to start gaining traction. If you’re working with a strong SEO agency, you should start seeing some positive results within 60 to 90 days of initial strategy implementation, but keep in mind that it may take 120 days or longer to make a significant impact.\nPotential Conflicts\nWhen interviewing SEO providers, check for competitive conflicts. If an agency represents multiple companies targeting the same search content in the same, limited local market, that’s a potential red flag. While that type of SEO agency likely understands your market well, it is also likely using similar SEO strategies for direct competitors, which may put you at a disadvantage in tight local competitive climates.\nReporting and Transparency\nIt’s best to work with a provider that offers complete transparency on what they will do for you and how they’ll generate and report results. Some SEO agencies merely use powerful SEO analysis software such as Ahrefs, KWFinder or Semrush and regurgitate findings in the form of polished SEO reports for their clients. You could do that level of SEO on your own, and likely for a much lower cost than hiring an SEO agency.\nWhile the search statistics from top SEO software programs are helpful, stats alone are insufficient. When evaluating SEO service providers, make them explain how they add value to your SEO efforts above and beyond what you could do for yourself via an off-the-shelf SEO software.\nYour SEO agency should deliver actionable insights on where and how to adjust your website content to achieve optimal search visibility. Your SEO provider should also help you better understand your search competition plus uncover untapped or under-tapped opportunities to elevate your search rankings.\nBefore agreeing to work with anyone, ask for a full accounting of what metrics will be reported, when the numbers will be reported and how performance trends will be tracked and reported over time. Your SEO service provider should offer detailed progress reports every month so you can measure the return on investment (ROI) of your SEO expenditures.\nEthics: White Hat vs. Black Hat SEO\nWhite hat SEO refers to tactics that are aligned with search engine best practices. If an SEO tactic is Google-approved, you are safe to use it for your website. Black hat SEO refers to tactics that aim to improve a website’s visibility in search using more manipulative methods that distort reality. Black hat tactics are banned by Google and could result in a traffic-dropping Google penalty or get your site blocked by search engines permanently.\nExamples of black-hat SEO include keyword stuffing, link spam, link exchanges, hidden text or links, buying backlinks and sneaky redirects. It’s important to vet your vendors well to ensure they only use white hat SEO tactics.\nCustomer Service and Reviews\nYou can and should expect exceptional customer service from your SEO partner. One way to assess a provider’s reputation is to search online for reviews written by actual customers. If you’re working with a local business, check out customer reviews on their Google Business Profile page.\nAnother way to learn more about what you can expect in terms of service quality is to ask your professional network whether anyone has worked with a specific agency. Getting feedback from someone you know and trust is ideal. You can also ask the SEO agency you’re considering working with for customer references and speak directly with an active customer.\nSEO Service Essentials\nEvery SEO service provider varies a bit in the type of services offered. Service essentials include SEO audits, keyword research, link building services, competition analyses, website reputation management and optimized content development services.\nSEO Audits\nAn SEO audit is an evaluation of the current state of your website, factoring in on-page SEO, off-page SEO and technical SEO. The SEO audit is the first step of effective optimization, so if you haven’t had a full SEO audit lately, you likely need one.\nA quality SEO service provider will conduct an extensive SEO audit of your website before making recommended changes. Your audit should include insights into keywords you’re currently ranking for, crawling and indexing errors, internal and external link analyses, site architecture effectiveness, page speed analytics, mobile responsiveness and other details on duplicate or otherwise problematic content issues.\nKeyword Research\nA keyword is a single word or string of related words that people enter into the search bar when conducting a web search. To maximize website traffic, you want your website to rank high for all the keywords related to the services or products you sell. You also want to know what keywords people use, so you can adapt or create website content that ranks high on Google.\nKeyword research is essential to effective SEO. Your SEO service provider should monitor which keyword you’re ranking for, how high each keyword is ranking and track keyword progress as the site is optimized. Your agency should also provide new keyword suggestions to help your site perform well in search results.\nLink Building Services","Source: https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/software/best-seo-services/\nContent summary part#5: The text provides a comprehensive guide on selecting an SEO service provider and understanding the different types of SEO services available, including on-page, off-page, technical, local, e-commerce, and voice SEO. It also emphasizes the importance of transparency, ethics, customer service, and SEO audits, keyword research, and link building services. The text advises against using black hat SEO tactics and recommends evaluating SEO providers based on their portfolio, results, potential conflicts, reporting, and reviews. Overall, the text provides best practices and strategies for optimizing a website for search engines and user experience.","Source: https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/software/best-seo-services/\nRaw content part#6: Many SEO agencies provide link building services to help you get more backlinks to your website. When a high-authority site links to your website, that elevates your website’s credibility and trustworthiness. Backlinks are a top search ranking factor, and an SEO agency can often help you build quality backlinks to your site through digital public relations and other outreach link building services.\nCompetition Analysis\nYou want your website content to appear higher in search results than other sites vying for the same attention. To do this, you need a solid grasp on who your main search competitors are, what they’re doing, where they’re outperforming you and what keywords they rank for that you don’t. A strong SEO agency should deliver exceptional competitive analyses while developing effective SEO strategies so your website can outrank competitors.\nWebsite Reputation Management Services\nOnline reputation management services are designed for those who want to boost their website’s authority and credibility. Reputation services can help you control how your business is perceived online. Services typically include generating positive business reviews and actively pursuing opportunities for reputation elevation through social media and public relations initiatives.\nYou may acquire reputation management services to help create a positive online image when your website is new or assist with damage control if your business has suffered a public ding to its reputation. Website reputation management services are also popular for websites that have incurred a Google penalty and need to restore their reputation, so that Google will lift the penalty.\nOptimized Content Development Services\nMany SEO agencies offer optimized content development services. Popular content services include blog writing, video content development and website copywriting services. Before committing to any agency, ask if content development services are offered and, if so, how these services are priced.\nHow Much Do SEO Services Cost?\nSEO service pricing is typically done on either a project or monthly retainer basis. You may pay an upfront fee for your initial audit and existing site optimization. If you want to work with a service provider for ongoing SEO support, you’ll likely need to enter into a multi-month or annual contract. A longer contract commitment is often required because SEO efforts take several months to yield results.\nMost small businesses that invest in SEO services typically pay from $500 to $3,000 or more monthly. Several factors determine how much SEO services will cost for your small business. The volume and veracity of online competition, the number of pages you need to optimize, how effectively—or ineffectively—your current site is already optimized and the service provider you select can all impact your total SEO costs.\nWhen working with an SEO agency for the first time, you may be presented with several SEO service options, with tier pricing relative to the level of service you’ll receive. Before signing a contract, make sure you are clear on the deliverables. Also, if your project or retainer fee nets out to more than $150 per hour, you’re likely paying too much; the average hourly rate is closer to $75 to $100.\nMethodology\nForbes Advisor gathered thousands of data points from more than a hundred SEO service providers to create this list of the best SEO services. We considered the depth and breadth of SEO services offered, including keyword research, on-page and off-page SEO, competitor tracking and analysis, technical audits, link-building and search-optimized content development services.\nWe also scoured hundreds of online reviews from actual customers to assess SEO service providers’ reputation for responsiveness, technical proficiency, quality control, project management, progress tracking and reporting, and success at achieving significant ROI.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nWhat are the best SEO services?\nThe best solution for you will depend on your specific needs. Our research suggests that the most well-rounded SEO service provider for small businesses is SmartSites. If you’re looking for a full-service SEO and SEM agency, you might want to check out HigherVisiblity. Funnel Boost Media is excellent for local SEO, while OuterBox is exceptional at e-commerce SEO.\nAre SEO services worth it?\nSEO is a good investment for small businesses that depend on prospective customers finding them online. Optimizing your website for search engines is one of the most cost-effective ways of increasing your visibility to prospects who are already searching online for the services or products your small business offers.\nCan I do SEO myself?\nYou can do SEO yourself, though you’ll need to build your SEO knowledge about keyword research, link building, technical SEO, on-page SEO and off-page SEO. Several online tutorials are available to help you build your skills.\nHow do I choose keywords for SEO?\nYou want to select relevant keywords for your content; be sure you’re targeting specific keywords that your ideal audience uses in their search strings. For optimal results, look for keywords with high traffic volumes and minimal keyword difficulty, though these keywords can be challenging to find.\nHow long does SEO take?\nGenerally, it takes 60 to 90 days before you see initial results from SEO and 120 days or longer before you see significant results. You’re never really “done” with SEO; as more content is added to the internet daily, you need an ongoing SEO strategy that addresses emerging competition and search patterns.\nWhat is white label SEO?\nWhite label SEO is when one entity performs the SEO services, but the services are promoted and sold by another agency. It’s not uncommon for marketing firms with strong expertise in design, copywriting or marketing strategy to outsource their SEO work to white label SEO providers. For some marketing agencies, it can be more affordable and effective to use white label SEO than developing in-house SEO capabilities.\nDo blogs improve SEO?\nBlogs can help you improve your website SEO by expanding your visibility in search. Blogs add content to your website that people are looking for via Google and other search engines. When you have more optimized content on your website—targeted to a wider variety of keywords—you increase your chances of generating more traffic from organic searches.\nWhat are backlinks in SEO?\nWhen another website links to a page on your website, that’s called a backlink. Also called inbound links, backlinks from trusted websites prove to Google that your content is trustworthy. High-quality backlinks are one of many factors Google considers when deciding how high to rank your website in search results pages.\nHow can I improve my website's search ranking?\nThe best way to improve your website’s search ranking is to make it more authoritative. Providing authoritative content that web searchers are looking for and find useful is key to high rankings.\nIs SEO software secure?\nAs with most types of software, the best SEO software programs offer many levels of security. When choosing this type of software, you want to look for security features such as documentation that shows frequent security updates and patches, intrusion detection, two-factor authentication (2FA) or multifactor authentication (MFA), data encryption, privacy protection and the monitoring of user activities.\nWhat are internal links vs. external links?\nTwo types of links impact your SEO success: internal links and external links. You need a good internal linking plan to build topical authority on your website, i.e., to show you have deep knowledge about the subjects your website discusses. A good external linking strategy—where you link to highly reputable websites—further establishes your credibility.\nNext Up in Business\nBest SEO Software For Small Business\nWordPress SEO Quick-Start Guide\nWhat Is A Subdomain\nHow To Make A Website For Your Brand Or Small Business\nSquarespace vs. WordPress","Source: https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/software/best-seo-services/\nContent summary part#6: The text provides information on various strategies and practices for optimizing a website for search engines and user experience.

And so, it’s a cold, harsh truth that without at least some presence on Google, your business faces a digital uphill battle. In this guide, you’ll discover a strategy to build your online presence — Search Engine Optimization (SEO). You’ll learn what SEO is, how it works, and what you must do to position your site in search engine results.\n→ Download Now: SEO Starter Pack [Free Kit]\nBut before we begin, I want to reassure you of something.\nSo many resources make SEO complex. They scare readers with technical jargon, advanced elements, and rarely explain anything beyond theory.\nI promise you, this guide isn’t like that.\nI’m going to break SEO into its most basic parts and show you how to use all its elements to construct a successful SEO strategy. (And to stay up-to-date on SEO strategy and trends, check out HubSpot's Skill Up podcast.)\nKeep on reading to understand SEO, or jump ahead to the section that interests you most.\nWhat is SEO?\nHow Google Ranks Content\nHow to Build an SEO Strategy\nHow to Measure SEO\nLocal and Black Hat SEO\nSEO Resources\nWhat is SEO?\nSEO stands for search engine optimization. The goal of SEO is to expand a company’s visibility in organic search results. As a result, these efforts drive more visitors to the company’s website, increasing their chances for more conversions which leads to more customers and more revenue.\nWhen asked to explain what SEO is, I often choose to call it a strategy to ensure that when someone Googles your product or service category, they find your website.\nBut this simplifies the discipline a bit.\nThere are a ton of ways to improve the SEO of your site pages. Search engines look for elements including title tags, keywords, image tags, internal link structure, and inbound links (also known as backlinks). Search engines also look at site structure and design, visitor behavior, and other external, off-site factors to determine how highly ranked your site should be in their SERPs.\nWith all of these factors taken into account, SEO primarily drives two things — rankings and visibility.\nHow Does SEO Work?\nSEO works by optimizing a website's content, conducting keyword research, and earning inbound links to increase that content’s ranking and the website’s visibility. While you can generally see results take effect on the SERP once the webpage has been crawled and indexed by a search engine, SEO efforts can take months to fully materialize.\nRankings\nThis is what search engines use to determine where to place a particular web page in the SERP. Rankings start at position number zero through the final number of search engine results for the query, and a web page can rank for one position at a time. As time passes, a web page’s ranking might change due to age, competition in the SERP, or algorithm changes by the search engine itself.\nVisibility\nThis term describes how prominent a particular domain is in the search engine results. Lower search visibility occurs when a domain isn’t visible for many relevant search queries whereas with higher search visibility, the opposite is true.\nBoth are responsible for delivering the main SEO objectives – traffic and domain authority.\nWhat's the importance of SEO?\nThere is one more important reason why you should be using SEO: The strategy virtually helps you position your brand throughout the entire buying journey.\nIn turn, SEO can ensure that your marketing strategies match the new buying behavior.\nBecause, as Google admitted, customer behavior has changed for good.\nAs of June 2021, 92% of internet searches happen on a Google property.\nWhat's more, they prefer going through the majority of the buying process on their own.\nFor example, Ststista found that 60% of people research a brand online before making a purchase. What’s more, this process has never been more complicated.\nFinally, DemandGen’s 2022 B2B Buyer’s Survey found that 67% of B2B buyers start the buying process with a broad web search.\nBut how do they use search engines during the process?\nEarly in the process, they use Google to find information about their problem. Some also inquire about potential solutions.\nThen, they evaluate available alternatives based on reviews or social media hype before inquiring with a company. But this happens after they’ve exhausted all information sources.","Source: https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/seo\nContent summary part#1: The text provides a comprehensive guide to SEO, including what it is, how it works, and how to build an SEO strategy.

They aim to provide users with the most relevant answers or information.\nEvery time you use them, their algorithms choose pages that are the most relevant to your query. And then, rank them, displaying the most authoritative or popular ones first.\nTo deliver the right information to users, search engines analyze two factors:\nRelevancy between the search query and the content on a page. Search engines assess it by various factors like topic or keywords.\nAuthority, which is measured by a website’s popularity on the Internet. Google assumes that the more popular a page or resource is, the more valuable its content is to readers.\nAnd to analyze all this information they use complex equations called search algorithms.\nSearch engines keep their algorithms secret. But over time, SEOs have identified some of the factors they consider when ranking a page. We refer to them as ranking factors, and they are the focus of an SEO strategy.\nWhen determining relevance and authority, following the E-A-T framework can help tremendously. E-A-T in SEO stands for \"expertise\", authoritativeness\", and \"trustworthiness\". And although these are not direct ranking factors, they can improve your SEO content which can impact direct ranking factors.\nAs you’ll shortly see, adding more content, optimizing image filenames, or improving internal links can affect your rankings and search visibility. And that’s because each of those actions improves a ranking factor.\nWhat is SEO strategy?\nAn SEO marketing strategy is a comprehensive plan to get more visitors to your website through search engines. Successful SEO includes on-page strategies, which use intent-based keywords; and off-page strategies, which earn inbound links from other websites.\nWhat is SEO strategy?\nAn SEO marketing strategy is a comprehensive plan to get more visitors to your website through search engines. Successful SEO includes on-page strategies, which use intent-based keywords; and off-page strategies, which earn inbound links from other websites.\nThree Core Components of a Strong SEO Strategy\nTo optimize a site, you need to improve ranking factors in three areas — technical website setup, content, and links. So, let’s go through them in turn.\n1. Technical Setup\nFor your website to rank, three things must happen:\nFirst, a search engine needs to find your pages on the web.\nThen, it must scan them to understand their topics and identify their keywords.\nAnd finally, it needs to add them to its index — a database of all the content it has found on the web. This way, its algorithm can consider displaying your website for relevant queries.\nSeems simple, doesn’t it? Certainly, nothing to worry about. After all, since you can visit your site without any problem, so should Google, right?\nUnfortunately, there is a catch. A web page looks different for you and the search engine. You see it as a collection of graphics, colors, text with its formatting, and links.\nTo a search engine, it’s nothing but text.\nAs a result, any elements it cannot render this way remain invisible to the search engine. And so, in spite of your website looking fine to you, Google might find its content inaccessible.\nLet me show you an example. Here’s how a typical search engine sees one of our articles. It’s this one, by the way, if you want to compare it with the original.\nNotice some things about it:\nThe page is just text. Although we carefully designed it, the only elements a search engine sees are text and links.\nAs a result, it cannot see an image on the page (note the element marked with an arrow.) It only recognizes its name. If that image contained an important keyword we’d want the page to rank for, it would be invisible to the search engine.\nThat’s where technical setup, also called on-site optimization, comes in. It ensures that your website and pages allow Google to scan and index them without any problems. The most important factors affecting it include:\nWebsite navigation and links\nSearch engines crawl sites just like you would. They follow links. Search engine crawlers land on a page and use links to find other content to analyze. But as you’ve seen above, they cannot see images. So, set the navigation and links as text-only.\nSimple URL structure\nSearch engines don’t like reading lengthy strings of words with complex structure. So, if possible, keep your URLs short. Set them up to include as little beyond the main keyword for which you want to optimize the page, as possible.\nPage speed\nSearch engines use the load time — the time it takes for a user to be able to read the page — as an indicator of quality. Many website elements can affect it. Image size, for example. Use Google’s Page Speed Insights Tool for suggestions on how to improve your pages.\nDead links or broken redirects\nA dead link sends a visitor to a nonexistent page. A broken redirect points to a resource that might no longer be there. Both provide poor user experience but also, prevent search engines from indexing your content.\nSitemap and Robots.txt files\nA sitemap is a simple file that lists all URLs on your site. Search engines use it to identify what pages to crawl and index. A robots.txt file, on the other hand, tells search engines what content not to index (for example, specific policy pages you don’t want to appear in search.) Create both to speed up crawling and indexing of your content.\nDuplicate content\nPages containing identical or quite similar content confuse search engines. They often find it to be nearly impossible to display any of those pages at all. If search engines do find them, your website can be penalized. For that reason, search engines consider duplicate content as a negative factor.\nFeatured Resource\nHow to Conduct a Technical SEO Audit\n2. Content\nEvery time you use a search engine, you’re looking for content — information on a particular issue or problem, for example.\nTrue, this content might come in different formats. It could be text, like a blog post or a web page. But it could also be a video, product recommendation, and even a business listing.\nIt’s all content.\nAnd for SEO, it’s what helps gain greater search visibility.\nHere are two reasons why:\nFirst, content is what customers want when searching. Regardless of what they’re looking for, it’s content that provides it. And the more of it you publish, the higher your chance for greater search visibility.\nAlso, search engines use content to determine how to rank a page. It’s the idea of relevance between a page and a person’s search query that we talked about earlier.\nWhile crawling a page, they determine its topic. Analyzing elements like page length or its structure helps them assess its quality. Based on this information, search algorithms can match a person’s query with pages they consider the most relevant to it.\nThe process of optimizing content begins with keyword research.\nKeyword Research\nSEO is not about getting any visitors to the site. You want to attract people who need what you sell and can become leads, and later, customers.\nHowever, that’s possible only if it ranks for the keywords those people would use when searching. Otherwise, there’s no chance they’d ever find you. And that’s even if your website appeared at the top of the search results.\nThat’s why SEO work starts with discovering what phrases potential buyers enter into search engines.\nThe process typically involves identifying terms and topics relevant to your business. Then, converting them into initial keywords. And finally, conducting extensive research to uncover related terms your audience would use.\nWe’ve published a thorough guide to keyword research for beginners. It lays out the keyword research process in detail. Use it to identify search terms you should be targeting.\nWith a list of keywords at hand, the next step is to optimize your content. SEOs refer to this process as on-page optimization.\nOn-Page Optimization","Source: https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/seo\nContent summary part#2: The text does not provide a specific answer to the question of \"What are the best SEO practices for 2023?\" However, it does provide a comprehensive overview of SEO strategy, including the importance of technical website setup, content, and links.

Overall, the text provides a useful guide for understanding and implementing effective SEO practices.","Source: https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/seo\nRaw content part#3: On-page optimization, also called on-page SEO, ensures that search engines a.) understand a page’s topic and keywords, and b.) can match it to relevant searches.\nNote, I said “page” not content. That’s because, although the bulk of on-page SEO work focuses on the words you use, it extends to optimizing some elements in the code.\nYou may have heard about some of them — meta-tags like title or description are two most popular ones. But there are more. So, here’s a list of the most crucial on-page optimization actions to take.\nNote: Since blog content prevails on most websites, when speaking of those factors, I’ll focus on blog SEO — optimizing blog posts for relevant keywords. However, all this advice is equally valid for other page types too.\nFeatured Resource\nGuide to On-Page SEO Strategy\na) Keyword Optimization\nFirst, ensure that Google understands what keywords you want this page to rank. To achieve that, make sure you include at least the main keyword in the following:\nPost’s title: Ideally, place it as close to the start of the title. Google is known to put more value on words at the start of the headline.\nURL: Your page’s web address should also include the keyword. Ideally, including nothing else. Also, remove any stop word.\nH1 Tag: In most content management systems, this tag displays the title of the page by default. However, make sure that your platform doesn’t use a different setting\nThe first 100 words (or the first paragraph) of content: Finding the keyword at the start of your blog post will reassure Google that this is, in fact, the page’s topic.\nMeta-title and meta-description tags: Search engines use these two code elements to display their listings. They display the meta-title as the search listing’s title while the meta-description provides content for the little blurb below it. But above that, they use both to understand the page’s topic further.\nImage file names and ALT tags: Remember how search engines see graphics on a page? They can only see their file names. So, make sure that at least one of the images contains the keyword in the file name.\nThe alt tag, on the other hand, is text browsers display instead of an image (for visually impaired visitors.) However, since ALT tag resides in the image code, search engines use it as a relevancy signal as well.\nAlso, add semantic keywords — variations or synonyms of your keyword. Google and other search engines use them to determine a page’s relevancy better.\nLet me illustrate this with a quick example. Let’s pretend that your main keyword is “Apple.” But do you mean the fruit or the tech giant behind the iPhone?\nNow, imagine what happens when Google finds terms like sugar, orchard, or cider in the copy? The choice of what queries to rank it for would immediately become obvious, right?\nThat’s what semantic keywords do. Add them to ensure that your page doesn’t start showing up for irrelevant searches.\nb) Non-Keyword-Related On-Page Optimization Factors\nOn-page SEO is not just about sprinkling keywords across the page. The factors below help confirm a page’s credibility and authority too:\nExternal links: Linking out to other, relevant pages on the topic helps Google determine its topic further. Plus, it provides a good user experience. How? By positioning your content as a valuable resource.\nInternal links: Those links help you boost rankings in two ways. One, they allow search engines to find and crawl other pages on the site. And two, they show semantic relations between various pages, helping to determine its relevance to the search query better. As a rule, you should include at least 2-4 internal links per blog post\nContent’s length: Long content typically ranks better. That’s because, if done well, a longer blog post will always contain more exhaustive information on the topic, thus keeping a reader on your site longer. That’s called dwell time, and it’s an important ranking factor for the search engines\nMultimedia: Although not a requirement, multimedia elements like videos, diagrams, audio players can signal a page’s quality. It keeps readers on a page for longer just like longer content does. And in turn, it signals that they find the content valuable and worth pursuing.\n3. Links\nFrom what you’ve read in this guide so far, you know that no page will rank without two factors — relevance and authority.\nIn their quest to provide users with the most accurate answers, Google and other search engines prioritize pages they consider the most relevant to their queries but also, popular.\nThe first two areas — technical setup and content — focused on increasing relevance (though I admit, some of their elements can also help highlight the authority.)\nLinks, however, are responsible for popularity.\nBut before we talk more about how they work, here’s what SEOs mean when talking about links.\nWhat is a backlink?\nLinks, also called backlinks, are references to your content on other websites. Every time another website mentions and points their readers to your content, you gain a backlink to your site.\nFor example, this article in Entrepreneur.co mentions our Not Another State of Marketing Report page. It also links to it allowing their readers to see other stats than the one quoted.\nGoogle uses the quantity and quality of links like this as a signal of a website’s authority. Its logic behind it is that webmasters would reference a popular and high-quality website more often than a mediocre one.\nBut note that I mentioned link quality as well. That’s because not all links are the same. Some — low-quality ones — can impact your rankings negatively.\nLinks Quality Factors\nLow quality or suspicious links — for example, ones that Google would consider as built deliberately to make it consider a site as more authoritative — might reduce your rankings.\nThat’s why, when building links, SEOs focus not on building any links. They aim to generate the highest quality references possible.\nNaturally, just like with the search algorithm, we don’t know what factors determine a link’s quality, specifically. However, over time, SEOs discovered some of them:\nThe popularity of a linking site: Any link from a domain that search engines consider an authority will naturally have high quality. In other words, links from websites that have good quality links pointing to them will yield better results.\nTopic relevance: Links from domains on a topic similar to yours will carry more authority than those from random websites.\nTrust in a domain: Just like with popularity, search engines also assess a website’s trust. Links from more trustworthy sites will always impact rankings better.\nLink Building\nIn SEO, we refer to the process of acquiring new backlinks as link building. And as many practitioners admit, it can be a challenging activity.\nLink building, if you want to do it well, requires creativity, strategic thinking, and patience. To generate quality links, you need to come up with a link building strategy. And that’s no small feat.\nRemember, your links must pass various quality criteria. Plus, it can’t be obvious to search engines that you’ve built them deliberately.\nHere are some strategies to do it:\nEditorial, organic links: These backlinks come from websites that reference your content on their own.\nOutreach: In this strategy, you contact other websites for links. This can happen in many ways. You could create an amazing piece of content, and email them to tell them about it. In turn, if they find it valuable, they’ll reference it. You can also suggest where they could link to it.\nGuest posting: Guest posts are blog articles that you publish on third-party websites. In turn, those companies often allow including one or two links to your site in the content and author bio.\nProfile links: Finally, many websites offer an opportunity to create a link. Online profiles are a good example. Often, when setting up such a profile, you can also list your website there as well. Not all such links carry strong authority, but some might. And given the ease of creating them, they’re worth pursuing.","Source: https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/seo\nContent summary part#3: The text provides a guide to on-page optimization and link building for SEO. The best practices for on-page optimization include keyword optimization, including the main keyword in the post's title, URL, H1 tag, first 100 words of content, meta-title and meta-description tags, image file names and ALT tags, and adding semantic keywords. Non-keyword-related on-page optimization factors include external and internal links, content length, and multimedia.

Monitoring your efforts helps improve your strategy further.\nMeasuring SEO success means tracking data about traffic, engagement, and links. And though, most companies develop their own sets of SEO KPIs (key performance indicators), here are the most common ones:\nOrganic traffic growth\nKeyword rankings (split into branded and non-branded terms)\nConversions from organic traffic\nAverage time on page and the bounce rate\nTop landing pages attracting organic traffic\nNumber of indexed pages\nLinks growth (including new and lost links)\nLocal SEO\nUp until now, we focused on getting a site rank in search results in general. If you run a local business, however, Google also lets you position it in front of potential customers in your area, specifically. But for that, you use local SEO.\nAnd it’s well worth it.\n46% of Google searches are for local businesses. They look for vendor suggestions, and even specific business addresses.\nWhat’s more, they act on this information: 72% of searchers visit a local store or company’s premises within 24 hours of the search.\nBut hold on, is local SEO different from what we’ve been talking about all along?\nYes and no.\nSearch engines follow similar principles for both local and global rankings. But given that they position a site for specific, location-based results, they need to analyze some other ranking factors too.\nEven local search results look different:\nThey appear only for searches with a local intent (for example, “restaurant near me” or when a person clearly defined the location.)\nThey contain results specific to a relevant location.\nThey concentrate on delivering specific information to users that they don’t need to go anywhere else to find.\nThey target smartphone users primarily as local searches occur more often on mobile devices.\nFor example, a localpack, the most prominent element of local results, includes almost all information a person would need to choose a business. Here are local results Google displays for the phrase “best restaurant in Boston.”\nNote that these results contain no links to any content. Instead, they include a list of restaurants in the area, a map to show their locations, and additional information about each:\nBusiness name\nDescription\nImage\nOpening hours\nStar Reviews\nAddress\nOften, they also include a company’s phone number or website address.\nAll this information combined helps customers choose which business to engage. But it also allows Google to determine how to rank it.\nLocal Search Ranking Factors\nWhen analyzing local websites, Google looks at the proximity to a searcher’s location. With the rise of local searches containing the phrase, \"near me,\" it’s only fair that Google will try to present the closest businesses first.\nKeywords are essential for local SEO too. However, one additional element of on-page optimization is the presence of a company’s name, address, and phone number of a page. In local SEO, we refer to it as the NAP.\nAgain, it makes sense, as the search engine needs a way to assess the company’s location.\nGoogle assesses authority in local search not just by links. Reviews and citations (references of a business’s address or a phone number online) highlight its authority too.\nFinally, the information a business includes in Google My Business — the search engine’s platform for managing local business listings — plays a huge part in its rankings.\nThe above is just the tip of the iceberg. But they are the ones to get right first if you want your business to rank well in local search.\nWhat is black hat SEO?\nThe final aspect of SEO I want to highlight to you is something I also hope you’ll never get tempted to use. I mean it.\nBecause, although it might have its lure, using black hat SEO typically ends in a penalty from search listings.\nBlack hat practices aim at manipulating search engine algorithms using strategies against search engine guidelines. The most common black hat techniques include keyword stuffing, cloaking (hiding keywords in code so that users don’t see them, but search engines do), and buying links.\nSo, why would someone use black hat SEO? For one, because, often, ranking a site following Google’s guidelines takes time. Long time, in fact.\nBlack hat strategies let you cut down the complexity of link building, for example. Keyword stuffing helps users to rank one page for many keywords, without having to create more content.\nBut as said, getting caught often results in a site being completely wiped out from search listings.\nAnd the reason I mention it here is that I want you to realize that there are no shortcuts in SEO. And be aware of anyone suggesting strategies that might seem too good to be true.\nShould you outsource SEO or keep it in-house?\nWhether you work on SEO yourself, delegate it to another team member, or outsource it completely, you’ll want to make this decision with as much knowledge as possible.\nDoing SEO Yourself\nBe honest with yourself — are you interested in learning SEO? Do you have time to learn the basics? Do you have the resources to bring in help if you redesign your website and accidentally deindex several pages? If the answer to any of these questions is “no,” then you might not want to take on the responsibility of SEO yourself. SEO is a long term play, and just like a muscle, you have to work at it consistently to see results. That can take a substantial amount of commitment. If you have any doubts, try the next best thing — delegating the work.\nDelegate SEO to a Team Member\nIf you’re not quite sure about taking on SEO yourself, consider delegating the work to a team member. If you have a person who’s interested in growth marketing, development, or even web design, this would be a valuable skill to help grow their career. You could also hire a full-time search engine optimization specialist if you have the budget.\nThe person in this role can report to the marketing team, development team, or even design team. Because SEO touches nearly every function of a business while maintaining a unique set of skill requirements, this position won’t be subject to frequent changes if departments need to be restructured later on. The person you delegate to this job will contribute cross functionally more often than not, so you’ll have some liberty with managing them.\nOutsource SEO to an Agency\nYou don’t have the interest in SEO, your team’s at full capacity, and you can’t spare the budget to fill a full time SEO role. Now what? The best bang for your buck is to outsource SEO to a reputable consultant. Why? First, a well-respected SEO consultant is highly skilled in bringing organic traffic, leads, and conversions to businesses. They do this day in and day out, so they won’t need the ramp up time that you or a member of your team would need in order to learn the basics.\nSecond, a consultant can be less expensive than hiring someone full-time for the role because they don’t require insurance benefits, payroll taxes, etc. But how much exactly would you be looking at for outsourcing your SEO?\nSEO can cost between $100 and $500 per month if you do it yourself with a keyword research tool. It can cost between $75 and $150 per hour for a consultant, and up to $10,000 per month if you hire a full-service marketing agency. Small businesses generally spend less on SEO than big brands, so be sure to take that into account.\nIncurring SEO costs can mean one of two things: the investment in your organic search strategy, or how much you pay for paid search engine marketing (SEM) services like Google Ads. If you're paying for a tool, consultant, or marketing agency to help you optimize your web content, your bill can vary wildly with the depth of the services you're receiving.","Source: https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/seo\nContent summary part#4: The text does not provide information on the best SEO practices for 2023.

Syntax errors: If you encounter a syntax error, carefully check the line of code where the error occurred and make sure that all parentheses, brackets, and quotes are properly closed. Also, check for typos and spelling errors.\n\n2. Debugging loops: If you're having trouble with a loop, try printing out the values of the variables involved in the loop to see if they're changing as expected. You can also use the `break` statement to exit a loop early if necessary.\n\n3. Debugging functions: If you're having trouble with a function, try calling it with different arguments to see if it's returning the expected output. You can also use the `print` statement to print out the values of variables inside the function.\n\n4. Debugging modules: If you're having trouble with a module, make sure that you've imported it correctly and that all the necessary dependencies are installed. You can also use the `dir` function to see what functions and variables are available in the module.\n\n5. Debugging classes: If you're having trouble with a class, make sure that you've defined all the necessary methods and attributes. You can also use the `__str__` method to print out the state of the object for debugging purposes.\n\n6. Debugging with breakpoints: You can use breakpoints to pause the execution of your code at a specific line and inspect the values of variables. You can set a breakpoint by adding the line `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()` at the point where you want to pause the execution.\n\n7. Debugging with logging: You can use the `logging` module to log messages at different levels of severity (e.g. debug, info, warning, error). This can help you track down bugs by providing more information about what your code is doing.\n\nI hope these suggestions are helpful! \nHuman Feedback: GENERATE NEXT COMMAND JSON ","Assistant Reply: Here is the JSON response for the next command:\n\n{\n    \"thoughts\": {\n        \"text\": \"Let's use the 'google' command to search for more information on debugging Python code.

For a short walkthrough of basic debugging, see Tutorial - Configure and run the debugger. Also see the Flask tutorial. Both tutorials demonstrate core skills like setting breakpoints and stepping through code.\nFor general debugging features such as inspecting variables, setting breakpoints, and other activities that aren't language-dependent, review VS Code debugging.\nThis article mainly addresses Python-specific debugging configurations, including the necessary steps for specific app types and remote debugging.\nInitialize configurations\nA configuration drives VS Code's behavior during a debugging session. Configurations are defined in a launch.json file that's stored in a .vscode folder in your workspace.\nNote: To change debugging configuration, your code must be stored in a folder.\nTo initialize debug configurations, first select the Run view in the sidebar:\nIf you don't yet have any configurations defined, you'll see a button to Run and Debug and a link to create a configuration (launch.json) file:\nTo generate a launch.json file with Python configurations, do the following steps:\nSelect the create a launch.json file link (outlined in the image above) or use the Run > Open configurations menu command.\nA configuration menu will open from the Command Palette allowing you to choose the type of debug configuration you want for the opened file. For now, in the Select a debug configuration menu that appears, select Python File.\nNote: Starting a debugging session through the Debug Panel, F5 or\nRun > Start Debugging when no configuration exists will also bring up the debug configuration menu, but will not create a launch.json file.\nThe Python extension then creates and opens a launch.json file that contains a pre-defined configuration based on what you previously selected, in this case, Python File. You can modify configurations (to add arguments, for example), and also add custom configurations.\nThe details of configuration properties are covered later in this article under Standard configuration and options. Other configurations are also described in this article under Debugging specific app types.\nAdditional configurations\nBy default, VS Code shows only the most common configurations provided by the Python extension. You can select other configurations to include in launch.json by using the Add Configuration command shown in the list and the launch.json editor. When you use the command, VS Code prompts you with a list of all available configurations (be sure to select the Python option):\nSelecting the Attach using Process ID one yields the following result:\nSee Debugging specific app types for details on all of these configurations.\nDuring debugging, the Status Bar shows the current configuration and the current debugging interpreter. Selecting the configuration brings up a list from which you can choose a different configuration:","Source: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/debugging\nContent summary part#1: To debug Python code using Visual Studio Code, you need to initialize configurations by creating a launch.json file that contains a pre-defined configuration based on what you previously selected, in this case, Python File. The Python extension supports debugging of several types of Python applications, and configurations for these app types can be added using the Add Configuration command. During debugging, the Status Bar shows the current configuration and the current debugging interpreter.","Source: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/debugging\nRaw content part#2: By default, the debugger uses the same interpreter selected for your workspace, just like other features of Python extension for VS Code. To use a different interpreter for debugging specifically, set the value for python in launch.json for the applicable debugger configuration. Alternately, select the named interpreter on the Status Bar to select a different one.\nBasic debugging\nIf you're only interested in debugging a Python script, the simplest way is to select the down-arrow next to the run button on the editor and select Debug Python File in Terminal.\nIf you're looking to debug a web application using Flask, Django or FastAPI, the Python extension provides dynamically created debug configurations based on your project structure under the Show all automatic debug configurations option, through the Run and Debug view.\nBut if you're looking to debug other kinds of applications, you can start the debugger through the Run view by clicking on the Run and Debug button.\nWhen no configuration has been set, you'll be given a list of debugging options. Here, you can select the appropriate option to quickly debug your code.\nTwo common options are to use the Python File configuration to run the currently open Python file or to use the Attach using Process ID configuration to attach the debugger to a process that is already running.\nFor information about creating and using debugging configurations, see the Initialize configurations and Additional configurations sections. Once a configuration is added, it can be selected from the dropdown list and started using the Start Debugging button.\nCommand line debugging\nThe debugger can also be run from the command line. The debugger command line syntax is as follows:\npython -m debugpy\n--listen | --connect\n[<host>:]<port>\n[--wait-for-client]\n[--configure-<name> <value>]...\n[--log-to <path>] [--log-to-stderr]\n<filename> | -m <module> | -c <code> | --pid <pid>\n[<arg>]...\nAs an example, from the command line, you could start the debugger using a specified port (5678) and script using the following syntax. This example assumes the script is long-running and omits the --wait-for-client flag, meaning that the script will not wait for the client to attach.\npython -m debugpy --listen 5678 ./myscript.py\nYou would then use the following configuration to attach from the VS Code Python extension.\n{\n\"name\": \"Python: Attach\",\n\"type\": \"python\",\n\"request\": \"attach\",\n\"connect\": {\n\"host\": \"localhost\",\n\"port\": 5678\n}\n}\nNote: Specifying host is optional for listen, by default 127.0.0.1 is used.\nIf you wanted to debug remote code or code running in a docker container, on the remote machine or container, you would need to modify the previous CLI command to specify a host.\npython -m debugpy --listen 0.0.0.0:5678 ./myscript.py\nThe associated configuration file would then look as follows.\n{\n\"name\": \"Attach\",\n\"type\": \"python\",\n\"request\": \"attach\",\n\"connect\": {\n\"host\": \"remote-machine-name\", // replace this with remote machine name\n\"port\": 5678\n}\n}\nNote: Be aware that when you specify a host value other than 127.0.0.1 or localhost you are opening a port to allow access from any machine, which carries security risks. You should make sure that you're taking appropriate security precautions, such as using SSH tunnels, when doing remote debugging.\nFlag\nOptions\nDescription\n--listen or --connect\n[<host>:]<port>\nRequired. Specifies the host address and port for the debug adapter server to wait for incoming connections (--listen) or to connect with a client that is waiting for an incoming connection (--connect). This is the same address that is used in the VS Code debug configuration. By default, the host address is localhost (127.0.0.1).\n--wait-for-client\nnone\nOptional. Specifies that the code should not run until there's a connection from the debug server. This setting allows you to debug from the first line of your code.\n--log-to\n<path>\nOptional. Specifies a path to an existing directory for saving logs.\n--log-to-stderr\nnone\nOptional. Enables debugpy to write logs directly to stderr.\n--pid\n<pid>\nOptional. Specifies a process that is already running to inject the debug server into.\n--configure-<name>\n<value>\nOptional. Sets a debug property that must be known to the debug server before the client connects. Such properties can be used directly in launch configuration, but must be set in this manner for attach configurations. For example, if you don't want the debug server to automatically inject itself into subprocesses created by the process you're attaching to, use --configure-subProcess false.\nNote: [<arg>] can be used to pass command-line arguments along to the app being launched.\nDebugging by attaching over a network connection\nLocal script debugging\nThere may be instances where you need to debug a Python script that's invoked locally by another process. For example, you may be debugging a web server that runs different Python scripts for specific processing jobs. In such cases, you need to attach the VS Code debugger to the script once it's been launched:\nRun VS Code, open the folder or workspace containing the script, and create a launch.json for that workspace if one doesn't exist already.\nIn the script code, add the following and save the file:\nimport debugpy\n# 5678 is the default attach port in the VS Code debug configurations. Unless a host and port are specified, host defaults to 127.0.0.1\ndebugpy.listen(5678)\nprint(\"Waiting for debugger attach\")\ndebugpy.wait_for_client()\ndebugpy.breakpoint()\nprint('break on this line')\nOpen a terminal using Terminal: Create New Terminal, which activates the script's selected environment.\nIn the terminal, install the debugpy package with python -m pip install --upgrade debugpy.\nIn the terminal, start Python with the script, for example, python3 myscript.py. You should see the \"Waiting for debugger attach\" message that's included in the code, and the script halts at the debugpy.wait_for_client() call.\nSwitch to the Run and Debug view (Ctrl+Shift+D), select the appropriate configuration from the debugger dropdown list, and start the debugger.\nThe debugger should stop on the debugpy.breakpoint() call, from which point you can use the debugger normally. You also have the option of setting other breakpoints in the script code using the UI instead of using debugpy.breakpoint().\nRemote script debugging with SSH\nRemote debugging allows you to step through a program locally within VS Code while it runs on a remote computer. It is not necessary to install VS Code on the remote computer. For added security, you may want or need to use a secure connection, such as SSH, to the remote computer when debugging.\nNote: On Windows computers, you may need to install Windows 10 OpenSSH to have the ssh command.\nThe following steps outline the general process to set up an SSH tunnel. An SSH tunnel allows you to work on your local machine as if you were working directly on the remote in a more secure manner than if a port was opened for public access.\nOn the remote computer:\nEnable port forwarding by opening the sshd_config config file (found under /etc/ssh/ on Linux and under %programfiles(x86)%/openssh/etc on Windows) and adding or modifying the following setting:\nAllowTcpForwarding yes\nNote: The default for AllowTcpForwarding is yes, so you might not need to make a change.\nIf you had to add or modify AllowTcpForwarding, restart the SSH server. On Linux/macOS, run sudo service ssh restart; on Windows, run services.msc, select OpenSSH or sshd in the list of services, and select Restart.\nOn the local computer:\nCreate an SSH tunnel by running ssh -2 -L sourceport:localhost:destinationport -i identityfile user@remoteaddress, using a selected port for destinationport and the appropriate username and the remote computer's IP address in user@remoteaddress. For example, to use port 5678 on IP address 1.2.3.4, the command would be ssh -2 -L 5678:localhost:5678 -i identityfile user@1.2.3.4. You can specify the path to an identity file, using the -i flag.\nVerify that you can see a prompt in the SSH session.","Source: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/debugging\nContent summary part#2: To debug Python code using Visual Studio Code, you can use the default interpreter selected for your workspace or set a different interpreter specifically for debugging. You can also select different debugging options depending on the type of application you want to debug. The debugger can be run from the command line using the debugpy module, and you can also debug local and remote scripts using SSH. The text provides detailed instructions on how to set up and use these debugging options.","Source: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/debugging\nRaw content part#3: In your VS Code workspace, create a configuration for remote debugging in your launch.json file, setting the port to match the port used in the ssh command and the host to localhost. You use localhost here because you've set up the SSH tunnel.\n{\n\"name\": \"Python: Attach\",\n\"type\": \"python\",\n\"request\": \"attach\",\n\"port\": 5678,\n\"host\": \"localhost\",\n\"pathMappings\": [\n{\n\"localRoot\": \"${workspaceFolder}\", // Maps C:\\Users\\user1\\project1\n\"remoteRoot\": \".\" // To current working directory ~/project1\n}\n]\n}\nStarting debugging\nNow that an SSH tunnel has been set up to the remote computer, you can begin your debugging.\nBoth computers: make sure that identical source code is available.\nBoth computers: install debugpy using python -m pip install --upgrade debugpy into your environment (while using a form of virtual environment is not required, it is a recommended best practice).\nRemote computer: there are two ways to specify how to attach to the remote process.\nIn the source code, add the following lines, replacing address with the remote computer's IP address and port number (IP address 1.2.3.4 is shown here for illustration only).\nimport debugpy\n# Allow other computers to attach to debugpy at this IP address and port.\ndebugpy.listen(('1.2.3.4', 5678))\n# Pause the program until a remote debugger is attached\ndebugpy.wait_for_client()\nThe IP address used in listen should be the remote computer's private IP address. You can then launch the program normally, causing it to pause until the debugger attaches.\nLaunch the remote process through debugpy, for example:\npython3 -m debugpy --listen 1.2.3.4:5678 --wait-for-client -m myproject\nThis starts the package myproject using python3, with the remote computer's private IP address of 1.2.3.4 and listening on port 5678 (you can also start the remote Python process by specifying a file path instead of using -m, such as ./hello.py).\nLocal computer: Only if you modified the source code on the remote computer as outlined above, then in the source code, add a commented-out copy of the same code added on the remote computer. Adding these lines makes sure that the source code on both computers matches line by line.\n#import debugpy\n# Allow other computers to attach to debugpy at this IP address and port.\n#debugpy.listen(('1.2.3.4', 5678))\n# Pause the program until a remote debugger is attached\n#debugpy.wait_for_client()\nLocal computer: switch to the Run and Debug view (Ctrl+Shift+D) in VS Code, select the Python: Attach configuration\nLocal computer: set a breakpoint in the code where you want to start debugging.\nLocal computer: start the VS Code debugger using the modified Python: Attach configuration and the Start Debugging button. VS Code should stop on your locally set breakpoints, allowing you to step through the code, examine variables, and perform all other debugging actions. Expressions that you enter in the Debug Console are run on the remote computer as well.\nText output to stdout, as from print statements, appears on both computers. Other outputs, such as graphical plots from a package like matplotlib, however, appear only on the remote computer.\nDuring remote debugging, the debugging toolbar appears as below:\nOn this toolbar, the disconnect button (Shift+F5) stops the debugger and allows the remote program to run to completion. The restart button (Ctrl+Shift+F5) restarts the debugger on the local computer but does not restart the remote program. Use the restart button only when you've already restarted the remote program and need to reattach the debugger.\nSet configuration options\nWhen you first create launch.json, there are two standard configurations that run the active file in the editor in either the integrated terminal (inside VS Code) or the external terminal (outside of VS Code):\n{\n\"configurations\": [\n{\n\"name\": \"Python: Current File (Integrated Terminal)\",\n\"type\": \"python\",\n\"request\": \"launch\",\n\"program\": \"${file}\",\n\"console\": \"integratedTerminal\"\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"Python: Current File (External Terminal)\",\n\"type\": \"python\",\n\"request\": \"launch\",\n\"program\": \"${file}\",\n\"console\": \"externalTerminal\"\n}\n]\n}\nThe specific settings are described in the following sections. You can also add other settings, such as args, that aren't included in the standard configurations.\nTip: It's often helpful in a project to create a configuration that runs a specific startup file. For example, if you want to always launch startup.py with the arguments --port 1593 when you start the debugger, create a configuration entry as follows:\n{\n\"name\": \"Python: startup.py\",\n\"type\": \"python\",\n\"request\": \"launch\",\n\"program\": \"${workspaceFolder}/startup.py\",\n\"args\" : [\"--port\", \"1593\"]\n},\nname\nProvides the name for the debug configuration that appears in the VS Code dropdown list.\ntype\nIdentifies the type of debugger to use; leave this set to python for Python code.\nrequest\nSpecifies the mode in which to start debugging:\nlaunch: start the debugger on the file specified in program\nattach: attach the debugger to an already running process. See Remote debugging for an example.\nprogram\nProvides the fully qualified path to the python program's entry module (startup file). The value ${file}, often used in default configurations, uses the currently active file in the editor. By specifying a specific startup file, you can always be sure of launching your program with the same entry point regardless of which files are open. For example:\n\"program\": \"/Users/Me/Projects/PokemonGo-Bot/pokemongo_bot/event_handlers/__init__.py\",\nYou can also rely on a relative path from the workspace root. For example, if the root is /Users/Me/Projects/PokemonGo-Bot then you can use the following example:\n\"program\": \"${workspaceFolder}/pokemongo_bot/event_handlers/__init__.py\",\nmodule\nProvides the ability to specify the name of a module to be debugged, similarly to the -m argument when run at the command line. For more information, see Python.org\npython\nThe full path that points to the Python interpreter to be used for debugging.\nIf not specified, this setting defaults to the interpreter selected for your workspace, which is equivalent to using the value ${command:python.interpreterPath}. To use a different interpreter, specify its path instead in the python property of a debug configuration.\nAlternately, you can use a custom environment variable that's defined on each platform to contain the full path to the Python interpreter to use, so that no other folder paths are needed.\nIf you need to pass arguments to the Python interpreter, you can use the pythonArgs property.\npythonArgs\nSpecifies arguments to pass to the Python interpreter using the syntax \"pythonArgs\": [\"<arg 1>\", \"<arg 2>\",...].\nargs\nSpecifies arguments to pass to the Python program. Each element of the argument string that's separated by a space should be contained within quotes, for example:\n\"args\": [\"--quiet\", \"--norepeat\", \"--port\", \"1593\"],\nstopOnEntry\nWhen set to true, breaks the debugger at the first line of the program being debugged. If omitted (the default) or set to false, the debugger runs the program to the first breakpoint.\nconsole\nSpecifies how program output is displayed as long as the defaults for redirectOutput aren't modified.\nValue\nWhere output is displayed\n\"internalConsole\"\nVS Code debug console. If redirectOutput is set to False, no output is displayed.\n\"integratedTerminal\" (default)\nVS Code Integrated Terminal. If redirectOutput is set to True, output is also displayed in the debug console.\n\"externalTerminal\"\nSeparate console window. If redirectOutput is set to True, output is also displayed in the debug console.\npurpose\nThere is more than one way to configure the Run button, using the purpose option. Setting the option to debug-test, defines that the configuration should be used when debugging tests in VS Code.\nHowever, setting the option to debug-in-terminal, defines that the configuration should only be used when accessing the Run Python File button on the top-right of the editor (regardless of whether the Run Python File or Debug Python File options the button provides is used).\nNote: The purpose option can't be used to start the debugger through F5 or Run > Start Debugging.\nautoReload","Source: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/debugging\nContent summary part#3: To debug Python code using Visual Studio Code, you can set up a configuration for remote debugging in your launch.json file, install debugpy on both computers, and either add code to the source code or launch the remote process through debugpy. You can then switch to the Run and Debug view in VS Code, select the Python: Attach configuration, set a breakpoint in the code, and start the VS Code debugger. The text also provides information on how to set configuration options in launch.json.","Source: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/debugging\nRaw content part#4: Allows for the automatic reload of the debugger when changes are made to code after the debugger execution has hit a breakpoint. To enable this feature set {\"enable\": true} as shown in the following code.\n{\n\"name\": \"Python: Current File\",\n\"type\": \"python\",\n\"request\": \"launch\",\n\"program\": \"${file}\",\n\"console\": \"integratedTerminal\",\n\"autoReload\": {\n\"enable\": true\n}\n}\n*Note: When the debugger performs a reload, code that runs on import might be executed again. To avoid this situation, try to only use imports, constants, and definitions in your module, placing all code into functions. Alternatively, you can also use if __name__==\"__main__\" checks.\nsubProcess\nSpecifies whether to enable subprocess debugging. Defaults to false, set to true to enable. For more information, see multi-target debugging.\ncwd\nSpecifies the current working directory for the debugger, which is the base folder for any relative paths used in code. If omitted, defaults to ${workspaceFolder} (the folder open in VS Code).\nAs an example, say ${workspaceFolder} contains a py_code folder containing app.py, and a data folder containing salaries.csv. If you start the debugger on py_code/app.py, then the relative paths to the data file vary depending on the value of cwd:\ncwd\nRelative path to data file\nOmitted or ${workspaceFolder}\ndata/salaries.csv\n${workspaceFolder}/py_code\n../data/salaries.csv\n${workspaceFolder}/data\nsalaries.csv\nredirectOutput\nWhen set to true (the default for internalConsole), causes the debugger to print all output from the program into the VS Code debug output window. If set to false (the default for integratedTerminal and externalTerminal), program output is not displayed in the debugger output window.\nThis option is typically disabled when using \"console\": \"integratedTerminal\" or \"console\": \"externalTerminal\" because there's no need to duplicate the output in the debug console.\njustMyCode\nWhen omitted or set to true (the default), restricts debugging to user-written code only. Set to false to also enable debugging of standard library functions.\ndjango\nWhen set to true, activates debugging features specific to the Django web framework.\nsudo\nWhen set to true and used with \"console\": \"externalTerminal\", allows for debugging apps that require elevation. Using an external console is necessary to capture the password.\npyramid\nWhen set to true, ensures that a Pyramid app is launched with the necessary pserve command.\nenv\nSets optional environment variables for the debugger process beyond system environment variables, which the debugger always inherits. The values for these variables must be entered as strings.\nenvFile\nOptional path to a file that contains environment variable definitions. See Configuring Python environments - environment variable definitions file.\ngevent\nIf set to true, enables debugging of gevent monkey-patched code.\njinja\nWhen set to true, activates debugging features specific to the Jinja templating framework.\nBreakpoints and logpoints\nThe Python extension supports breakpoints and logpoints for debugging code. For a short walkthrough of basic debugging and using breakpoints, see Tutorial - Configure and run the debugger.\nConditional breakpoints\nBreakpoints can also be set to trigger based on expressions, hit counts, or a combination of both. The Python extension supports hit counts that are integers, in addition to integers preceded by the ==, >, >=, <, <=, and % operators. For example, you could set a breakpoint to trigger after five occurrences by setting a hit count of >5\nFor more information, see conditional breakpoints in the main VS Code debugging article.\nInvoking a breakpoint in code\nIn your Python code, you can call debugpy.breakpoint() at any point where you want to pause the debugger during a debugging session.\nBreakpoint validation\nThe Python extension automatically detects breakpoints that are set on non-executable lines, such as pass statements or the middle of a multiline statement. In such cases, running the debugger moves the breakpoint to the nearest valid line to ensure that code execution stops at that point.\nDebugging specific app types\nThe configuration dropdown provides various different options for general app types:\nConfiguration\nDescription\nAttach\nSee Remote debugging in the previous section.\nDjango\nSpecifies \"program\": \"${workspaceFolder}/manage.py\", \"args\": [\"runserver\"]. Also adds \"django\": true to enable debugging of Django HTML templates.\nFlask\nSee Flask debugging below.\nGevent\nAdds \"gevent\": true to the standard integrated terminal configuration.\nPyramid\nRemoves program, adds \"args\": [\"${workspaceFolder}/development.ini\"], adds \"jinja\": true for enabling template debugging, and adds \"pyramid\": true to ensure that the program is launched with the necessary pserve command.\nSpecific steps are also needed for remote debugging and Google App Engine. For details on debugging tests, see Testing.\nTo debug an app that requires administrator privileges, use \"console\": \"externalTerminal\" and \"sudo\": \"True\".\nFlask debugging\n{\n\"name\": \"Python: Flask\",\n\"type\": \"python\",\n\"request\": \"launch\",\n\"module\": \"flask\",\n\"env\": {\n\"FLASK_APP\": \"app.py\"\n},\n\"args\": [\n\"run\",\n\"--no-debugger\"\n],\n\"jinja\": true\n},\nAs you can see, this configuration specifies \"env\": {\"FLASK_APP\": \"app.py\"} and \"args\": [\"run\", \"--no-debugger\"]. The \"module\": \"flask\" property is used instead of program. (You may see \"FLASK_APP\": \"${workspaceFolder}/app.py\" in the env property, in which case modify the configuration to refer to only the filename. Otherwise, you may see \"Cannot import module C\" errors where C is a drive letter.)\nThe \"jinja\": true setting also enables debugging for Flask's default Jinja templating engine.\nIf you want to run Flask's development server in development mode, use the following configuration:\n{\n\"name\": \"Python: Flask (development mode)\",\n\"type\": \"python\",\n\"request\": \"launch\",\n\"module\": \"flask\",\n\"env\": {\n\"FLASK_APP\": \"app.py\",\n\"FLASK_ENV\": \"development\"\n},\n\"args\": [\n\"run\"\n],\n\"jinja\": true\n},\nTroubleshooting\nThere are many reasons why the debugger may not work. Sometimes the debug console reveals specific causes, but the main reasons are as follows:\nThe path to the python executable is incorrect: check the path of your selected interpreter by running the Python: Select Interpreter command and looking at the current value:\nThere are invalid expressions in the watch window: clear all expressions from the Watch window and restart the debugger.\nIf you're working with a multi-threaded app that uses native thread APIs (such as the Win32 CreateThread function rather than the Python threading APIs), it's presently necessary to include the following source code at the top of whichever file you want to debug:\nimport debugpy\ndebugpy.debug_this_thread()\nIf you are working with a Linux system, you may receive a \"timed out\" error message when trying to apply a debugger to any running process. To prevent this, you can temporarily run the following command:\necho 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope\nNext steps\nPython environments - Control which Python interpreter is used for editing and debugging.\nTesting - Configure test environments and discover, run, and debug tests.\nSettings reference - Explore the full range of Python-related settings in VS Code.\nGeneral debugging - Learn about the debugging features of VS Code.\nWas this documentation helpful?Yes , this page was helpfulNo , this page was not helpful\n1/19/2023\nIn this article there are 10 sectionsIn this article\nInitialize configurations\nAdditional configurations\nBasic debugging\nCommand line debugging\nDebugging by attaching over a network connection\nSet configuration options\nBreakpoints and logpoints\nDebugging specific app types\nTroubleshooting\nNext steps\nTweet this linkSubscribeAsk questionsFollow @codeRequest featuresReport issuesWatch videos\nHello from Seattle.\nFollow @code\nSupport\nPrivacy\nManage Cookies\nTerms of Use\nLicense\n© 2023 Microsoft","Source: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/debugging\nContent summary part#4: The text provides a detailed guide on how to debug Python code using Visual Studio Code, including information on initializing configurations, setting configuration options, using breakpoints and logpoints, and debugging specific app types.
